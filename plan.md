# MVP:

Each player has a character.
Each character can have a house with storage and such. (Another table?)
Each living being has stats. These stats impact attack power, magic damage, etc.
The player can equip swords, armor etc. (New equipment table.)

## Game ideas:
Player wakes up in a forest => `you should start gathering some wood and build a shelter`.
Players can build houses to hide from stuff in the night.
Introduce crafting for items, armor, weapons. Might also be used for cooking.

# Stretch goals:

Save coordinates in a world map, for all players. They can move around the map.
Instantiate entities on the world map so that players encounter them organically.
Find stuff outside of combat that can be impacted by stats.
